# What2Eat
This is a simple C program that allows the user(s) to choose a dish between a pre-defined list of dishes in two rounds.

## How It Works
* First, the program asks for the number of users.
* After the number of users is entered, the voting starts and every user enters their choices with their respective priorities.
* When the voting ends, the dishes which pass the threshold (which is 10) are printed and become shortlisted.
* If there isn't any dish that has 10 points, the program ends.
* Then another vote starts for the shortlisted dishes.
* The dish that gets the most votes wins.
